Food Find allows users to find a random restaurant to go to based on their location, how far they want to go, and what they want to eat. This helps users find a place to go when they're feeling indecisive and discover new places to eat. The app also allows users to save where they've been and mark favorites, as well as do a search that will bring a random restaurant from their favorites.
